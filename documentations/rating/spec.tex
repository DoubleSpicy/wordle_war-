	A rating system proposed for the player-to-player+word, word-to-player dynamic rating system, inspired from codeforces' elo system.

\section{Formulation}
	For player $i$ of rating $R_i$ dueling against $j$ of rating $R_j$, with words of each of their own being $w_i$ and $w_j$, we have the following:
	
	To begin with, player's initial rating is set as 1500, each words's rating randomly normal distributed at $N\sim(1500, 1)$.
	
	We define the winrate of $i$ winning against $j$ as:
	\begin{equation}
		E(P_{i,j}) = \frac{1}{1+10^\small{(R_j - R_i)/40}}}
	\end{equation}
	
	Then, the new Rating of $i$ is:
	\begin{equation}
		R_i^{'} = R_i + \epsilon(I_{result} - \sqrt{E_{i,j} E_{i, w_i}} )
	\end{equation}
	Update function of word $w_i$ is similar,
	\begin{equation}
		E(P_{i,w}) = \frac{1}{1+10^\small{(R_w - R_i)/40}}}
	\end{equation}
